    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was never a poet more admired in his life or more despised after
    his death than Quarles. He was patronized by the best of his age while
    living, and when dead was first criticised, then contemned, and last
    of all totally forgotten, unless when some bard wanted a name of one
    syllable to fill up a list of miserable rhymers. Pope was the last who
    made this use of him,<span class="pagenum">6</span>
    and at the same time, in a note, abused Benlowes
    for being his patron. I think it is Sir Philip Sidney who says that no
    piece was ever a favourite of the common people without merit. Now,
    though every thing I had heard of Quarles was much in his disfavour,
    I could not help thinking but that he had something good in him, from
    my never seeing one of his books of emblems that was not worn to rags;
    a sign of its being read a good deal, unless it may be imagined that
    it was so used by children in turning over the prints. Be that as it
    may, I have perused as much of him as a very dirty tattered book would
    give me leave, and will risque the declaring, that where he is good,
    I know but<span class="pagenum">7</span>
    few poets better. He has a great deal of genuine fire,
    is frequently happy in similies, admirable in epithets and compound
    words, very smooth in his versification, so different from the poets
    of his own age; and possessed that great qualification of keeping you
    in perpetual alarm, so very different from the elegant writers of the
    present times.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have run through his book of emblems to select some passages for
    your observation—they are buried, it must be confessed, in a heap
    of rubbish, but are of too much value not to be worth some pains in
    recovering.—Where Quarles is bad, “he sounds the very base-string
    of humility”—but this may be said<span class="pagenum">8</span>
    of Shakspeare and Milton as
    well.—I mean not to put him in the same rank with these two poets; he
    has a much greater proportion of bad to good than is to be found in
    them, so much indeed as almost to prevent his good from appearing at
    all. My intention is to clear some of his shining passages of their
    incumbrances; which may occasion their being noticed, and preserved
    from oblivion.

    The first, will probably remind you of Shakspeare’s description of the
    wounded stag in <cite>As you like it</cite>; which it may do, and not suffer by
    the comparison. The second, is very original in the expression—the

    The following verses allude to the print prefixed, where a bubble is
    represented as heavier than the globe. It is necessary to observe, that
    the prints were designed first, and the poems are in a great measure
    explanatory of them.

  <p>
    Tho’ the considering mortality on the gloomy side, is not productive
    of much happiness, yet there are certain dispositions which feel
    some gratification in it—Quarles was one of these. He seizes all
    opportunities of abusing the world; and it must be confessed he has
    here done it in “choice and elegant terms.”

    “Read on <em>this</em> dial”—“Behold <em>these</em> lilies”—does not this put you
    in mind of the same form of expression in Ossian? “His spear was like

    Quarles was commenting on his print in which the dial and lilies were
    represented; Ossian saw his images “in his mind’s eye”——but both the

    exist to their readers.

    The closeness of the reasoning, and the freedom of the verses cannot be
    enough admired. I believe it would be difficult if not impossible to
    reason so shortly and yet so clearly in prose. Pope says the thoughts
    in his Essay on Man are in less compass for their being in verse. The
    poetical language admits of elisions and other varieties we cannot have
    in prose. This poem is followed by another, before which is a design of
    the winds blowing the flame of the taper, with this

    Tho’ I have purposely omitted pointing out many of the particular
    beauties of these poems, I would wish you to observe, in this last, the
    fine effect of compound words in which this author is so happy: also
    the noble swell in the third<span class="pagenum">26</span>
    stanza—the application of his allegory
    to its meaning, in the fourth, where the expression so admirably
    suits with both “our peaceful flame, &amp;c.”——if these are not genuine
    strokes of genius, I must, as a great critic says on a like occasion,
    acknowledge my ignorance of such subjects. I wish we had some word in
    our language to express the same idea in poetry as <i xml:lang="la">crescendo</i> does in
    music; swell is applied to so many other purposes, that it has not the
    effect of an appropriated term.
  </p>

  <p>
    But for the present I must quit the subject—in a little time expect
    the remainder of my observations on this poet.

    <span class="dropcap">E</span>VERY one seems to be satisfied that warm colouring is essential to
    a good picture: but what <em>is</em> warm colouring is not determined. Some
    have joined the idea of warmth to yellow, others to red, others to the
    compound of both, the orange—they also differ in the degrees of each.
    A warm picture to some, is cold to others; and vice versa. Lambert’s
    idea of warmth, was to make his pictures appear as if they were behind
    a yellow glass. Vanbloom’s have a red glass before
    <span class="pagenum">28</span> them. Both’s an

    Nature. All these hues are right as <em>particulars</em>, but wrong as
    <em>universals</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us examine the different appearances of light from the dawn to
    noon. The first break of day is a cold light in the East—this, by
    degrees, is tinged with purple, which grows redder and redder until
    the purple is lost in orange—the orange in yellow, and before the sun
    is two degrees high, the yellow is changed to white. Invert the order
    of these, and it is the coming on of the evening. All these hues
    <span class="pagenum">29</span> then
    exist in nature, and one is just as right as the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is necessary to distinguish between the painter’s <em>warmth</em>, and the
    sensation. A picture, that has most warmth of colouring, represents
    that time of the day when we feel least. A true representation of noon
    must have no tinge of yellow or red in the sky; and yet from its being
    noon, one might be led to imagine it must be <em>warm</em>. It is the critic,
    and not the artist, which confounds the meaning of these terms. In like
    manner, summer and winter, in respect to light, are just the same: the
    sun rises and sets as gorgeously in December, if the weather be clear,
    as in June. I remember seeing two pictures of
    <span class="pagenum">30</span> Cuyp, companions—one,
    a cattle piece in summer; the other, winter with figures skaiting. The
    sky in both was equally <em>warm</em>, for which the painter was much censured
    by an auction-connoisseur, who declared that it was impossible the sky
    could be <em>warm</em> in winter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I believe it is a common mistake to apply the red and purple tints to
    the morning, and the orange and yellow to the evening. We hear pictures
    of Claude called mornings and evenings, which may be either. It is
    really odd enough, that there should not be a single circumstance to
    distinguish the morning from the evening, unless it be in a view of a
    particular place—in this case, the reversing of the light shews the
    <span class="pagenum">31</span>
    difference. In a picture, there is no distinction between going to
    work, or milking, or returning from it—men ride, drive cattle, are
    fishing, &amp;c. as well early as late.
  </p>

  <p>
    These considerations should soften the peremptory style of some judges,
    and extend their taste, which at present seems much confined. We have
    seen that there are more natural hues than one or two. I will allow
    them to say, that a picture is too warm, too cold, too red, too yellow
    to please them, but let them not deny that these hues are all in
    nature, and that well-managed they are all pictoresque.

    <span class="dropcap">A</span>T the revival of the arts, some evil genius, who was determined to
    retard the progress of painting, dictated this rule. “A picture should
    always have its horizon the height of the eye <em>that looks at it</em>—in
    nature, the eye being always the height of the horizon; therefore a
    picture will be most like nature that has its horizon the height of the
    <em>natural eye</em>.” One of the falsest rules that ever was founded on a
    false principle! and this is the more lamentable, as it has spoiled,
    <span class="pagenum">33</span>
    in point of perspective, three parts of the historical pictures that
    have ever been painted.
  </p>

  <p>
    As it is very difficult to destroy a rooted error, and as this is a
    most pernicious one, it is necessary to be full and particular.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I say <em>eye</em> and <em>horizon</em>—the natural eye and horizon are meant.
    When the terms <em>artificial eye</em> and <em>artificial horizon</em> are used, the
    eye and the horizon represented in painting are to be understood. We
    must be clear in this distinction, for it is the confounding of the
    ideas expressed by these terms which has occasioned the mischief.
  </p>

  <p>The eye, and the horizon, are always of the same height—therefore</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">34</span></p>

  <p>The artificial eye and the artificial horizon must always be so—but</p>

  <p>
    There is no connection between the <em>real</em> eye, and the <em>artificial</em>
    horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    In every picture the artificial eye, or point of sight, is supposed to
    be at a certain height from the base-line; as high as a human figure
    would be, represented as standing there. To this point every thing in
    the picture tends, as every thing in a real view tends to the natural
    eye. The picture then, as far as this circumstance is concerned, is
    perfect, if the <em>artificial</em> eye and the <em>artificial</em> horizon go
    together; for these always bear the same relation to each other, let
    the picture be placed any where.
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <span class="pagenum">35</span>
    <img src="images/i35.jpg" width="369" height="600" alt="" />
  </div>

  <p>
    Let A be the eye, B the picture (in section) and c the horizon of the
    picture.—The eye is always the<span class="pagenum">36</span>
    apex of the cone; there is constantly
    the same relation between the parts in every position. It must be
    observed that there is a defect in this illustration which it was
    impossible to avoid—for tho’ I have considered A as the eye, yet
    <em>upon paper</em>, it is <em>artificial</em> as well as the picture B. If you cannot
    make this distinction, I propose the following demonstration.——Take
    a landscape and stand it upon a table—hang it up the height of the
    eye—above the height—put it upon a chair—upon the floor—it still,
    perspectively considered, is seen equally well—for
  </p>

  <p>
    The <em>real</em> eye is always the height of the <em>artificial</em> eye, whether
    the picture be fixed in the cieling or laid upon the floor.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">37</span></p>

  <p>
    Indeed if this was not so, how would it be possible to hang one picture
    over another? and yet this is done, and with the greatest propriety.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have often lamented the shifts to which painters are reduced, who
    have followed this rule in opposition to their senses. Laresse was so
    thoroughly possessed with it, that his idea of fitting up a room with
    pictures, was to have those which were below the eye to contain nothing
    but ground, and those which were above, the sky and clouds. But though
    he was convinced of the rectitude of his principle, he was struck with
    the oddity of the practice—he therefore recommended that there should
    be but one<span class="pagenum">38</span>
    picture from the floor to the cieling, in which there might
    be a perfect coincidence of the natural and artificial horizon.
  </p>

  <p>
    A portrait-painter sets the person he is to draw generally the height
    of his eye.——Suppose it to be a whole-length with a landscape in
    the back-ground: the artist considers his picture is to hang above
    the eye, and for that reason makes his horizon low, about the height
    of the knees. The consequence is, that there are two points of sight,
    which supposes an impossibility; for the eye cannot be in two places
    at the same time. If the eye be supposed on a level with the head of
    the figure, as it was on drawing the face, then the back-ground is
    <span class="pagenum">39</span>
    too low; if equal to the horizon of the back-ground, then the figure
    is too high, unless we suppose it on an eminence, or ourselves in a
    pit; in that case, instead of seeing the face in front, we must have
    looked under the chin—but as we do not, the figure always appears to
    be falling forward.
  </p>

  <p>
    Raffaele’s horizon is most commonly the height of his figures, so that
    they stand properly, and seem to be, whether in a print or a picture,
    the size of human creatures;—on the contrary, when the horizon is low,
    the figures always appear gigantic. When I was a boy, I had formed so
    very exalted an idea of the size of running horses, from seeing them
    drawn with the<span class="pagenum">40</span>
    distant hills appearing under their bodies, that the
    first time I was at a course, it appeared but as a rat-race.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every whole length picture will furnish you with an instance of this
    false principle, which would appear more disagreeable, if custom
    had not in some measure reconciled us to it. I am aware that the
    practice of so many great men is a strong objection to my argument;
    but as I conceive, with due submission to such authority, that there
    is <em>demonstration</em> on my side, I cannot easily retract what I have
    advanced.

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE commentators of Shakspeare think themselves obliged to find some
    meaning in his nonsense; and to come at it, twist and turn his words
    without mercy: never considering, that in his scenes, as in common
    life, some part must be necessarily unimportant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many a passage has been criticised into consequence. The meaning, to
    use Shakspeare’s words on a like occasion, “is like a grain of wheat
    hid in a bushel of chaff; you shall seek all day e’er you find it, and
    <span class="pagenum">42</span>
    when you have it, it is not worth the search.”
  </p>

  <p>
    An expression of <cite>Shallow</cite>’s in the second part of Henry the fourth
    has been the subject of much criticism and hypercriticism. “We will
    eat a last year’s pippin with a dish of carraways;” and it is certain
    that there was such a dish, but if Shakspeare had meant it, he would
    have said, “A dish of last year’s pippins with carraways”—“<em>with</em> a
    dish, &amp;c.” clearly means something distinct from the pippins. Roasted
    pippins stuck full of carraways, says one—carraway confect, or comfit
    well known to children, says another—as if every one did not know
    what carraway comfits were, says a third, laughing at the second.
    Dine with<span class="pagenum">43</span> any of the <em>natural</em> inhabitants of Bath about Christmas,
    and they probably will give you after dinner a dish of pippins and
    carraways—which last is the name of an apple as well known in that
    country as nonpareil is in London, and as generally associated with
    golden pippins.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Then am I a sous’d gurnet,” lays Falstaff. This fish has puzzled the
    commentators as much as the apple did before.—What can it be?—I
    never heard of such a fish.—There is no such fish. A magazine critic,
    assured of its non-existence, proposed reading <em>grunt</em>, gurnet, quasi
    grunet, quasi grunt——well, and what do we get by that? Why, because
    hogs grunt, and pork is<span class="pagenum">44</span>
    the flesh of hogs, sous’d gurnet means pickled
    pork! Very lately a commentator, who once denied its existence, has
    discovered in consequence of his great learning, that there is <em>really</em>
    such a fish——he is <em>really</em> in the right—if he will go to the South
    coast of Devonshire, he may see plenty of them—but not <em>sous’d</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now I mention Falstaff, let me explain his copper ring. He
    complains of being robbed when he was asleep, and “losing a seal-ring
    of his <em>grandfather’s</em> worth forty marks.” “O Jesu,” says the hostess,
    “I have heard the prince tell him I know not how oft, that the ring was
    <em>copper</em>.” Is the appearance of copper so much like gold, that one
    <span class="pagenum">45</span>
    may be mistaken for the other? Formerly, (about the time of Falstaff’s
    grandfather) gold was a scarce commodity in England, so scarce that
    they frequently made rings of copper and plated them thinly with gold;
    I have seen two or three of them. As the look of both was alike,
    Falstaff might insist upon its being gold; on the contrary, the prince,
    from the quality of the wearer and lightness of the ring, might with
    equal fairness maintain that it was only plated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though it is not my intention to make one of the number of Shakspeare’s
    commentators, I will take this opportunity of restoring a passage in
    King Lear. In the<span class="pagenum">46</span>
    agony of his passion with his daughter, he says (in the modern editions)
  </p>

  <div class="poetry-container">
    <div class="poetry">

        <div class="i0">“Th’ <em>untented</em> woundings of a Father’s curse</div>
        <div class="i0">Pierce every sense about thee.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    In the old editions it is printed exceeding plainly, “Th’ <em>untender</em>
    woundings, &amp;c.” that is, not tender, or cruel. It would be waste
    of time to shew its propriety, and that there is no such word as
    <em>untented</em>. Who first threw out the true reading and substituted the
    false, I know not. Is it worth while to say, that the word is often
    used by Shakspeare, and once at least besides in the same play, “so
    young and so untender?”

    </div>
  </div>

    <p class="noindent">
    that is, because they are so <em>affected</em>. These poor lines have been
    new-worded, new stopped, and all to find the meaning of as plain a
    passage as can be written. “Some men cannot abide this thing, others
    have an aversion to another, which sometimes produces strange effects
    on their bodies, because their imagination is so strongly <em>affected</em>.
    Masterless passion, suffering, or feeling, compels them to follow
    the impulse.” The not understanding<span class="pagenum">48</span>
    <em>affection</em> and <em>passion</em> in

    good to attend to propriety. As<span class="pagenum">51</span>
    it is the wicked custom of the world
    to press down a falling man, the said <em>To</em> is in a manner totally
    displaced from his ancient possession: all people, except the very few
    who prefer grammar to fashion, agreeing to his removal. Were his place
    filled by a worthy successor he should keep his complaints secret,
    remembering that he himself succeeded <em>For</em>—but to be succeeded by
    nothing, is reviving the old fanatic principle of the last century,
    which all who are lovers of the constitution must shudder at! Consider
    good people, you who so well know the value of property, what
    quantities of letters are at this instant in the post-office that are
    neither <em>To</em> nor <em>For</em> any person? In many instances
    <span class="pagenum">52</span> you condescend to

    you not use the dative case—and pray what is the sign of the dative
    but your petitioner

  <p class="rightinset"><em>To?</em></p>

  <p>Secondly, <em>The</em> for himself says,</p>

  <p>
    That he has had, from the first existence of our language, precedence
    of army, navy, commons, lords, and even government itself;—that he
    is most basely removed from this his just station—for he appeals to
    all impartial judges, if such are to be found, what a foolish figure
    does army, navy, commons,<span class="pagenum">53</span>
    lords, and government cut without he takes
    the lead. If this were alone the damage it is surely of great concern,
    but alas! the evil is spreading! scarce a day passes but he loses
    some ancient possession of trust and consequence! It is, indeed,
    insinuated, that your petitioner formerly usurped a station he had by
    no means a right to, and that his present loss is a just retaliation.
    What business had <em>The</em>, says these meddlers, before <cite>Faustina</cite> and

    consequence—if you destroy your particles and articles, and reduce
    your language by degrees to noun substantives, who knows but the next

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Cannot agree with you in the cause of that uncommon production you
    mention; my thoughts on this subject, and on some others connected with
    it, will appear by the following reflections.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until the last hundred years or thereabout, it was supposed that in
    many instances life was produced by putrefaction, fermentation, &amp;c.
    Leuwenhoek and other naturalists, clearly demonstrated that some
    animals which were supposed to owe their existence to the above
    causes,<span class="pagenum">57</span>
    or in other words, to spontaneous generation, really had a
    regular production. This discovery established the general principle of
    <i xml:lang="la">omnia ab ovo</i>—but it must be received with reserve and exception.
  </p>

  <p>
    After giving every theory of the earth a patient reading, it seems to
    me probable that the whole world was originally covered with water
    to the depth of about three miles, which is about as much below the
    surface, as the highest mountains rise above it. This depth, though far
    below all soundings, bears no more proportion to the earth’s diameter,
    than that of the paper it is covered with does to a common globe. The
    idea of the sea approaching the center, and of course,
    <span class="pagenum">58</span> possessing
    a superior share in quantity as well as surface of the earth, has
    occasioned many difficulties in accounting for the balance between the
    different sides of the globe; which vanish, if the sea is not supposed
    of a greater depth than necessity requires, or reason and probability
    warrant.
  </p>

  <p>
    I consider all continents as a congeries of islands heaved up from
    the bottom of the sea at different times by vulcanos and earthquakes.
    Modern philosophers have discovered ancient vulcanos where they were
    never suspected to have existed, and the whole earth is full of
    evidence that it was once beneath the ocean. Marble, freestone, and
    many other substances abound in seashells
    <span class="pagenum">59</span> and marine productions. It
    is frequently said that the sea has left many places which were once
    covered by it. Is it not rather to be supposed that those places have
    been elevated above the sea, than that the sea has sunk below them?
    There seems to be no cause in nature equal to the altering the quantity
    of water in the ocean, but we know that there are many causes equal to
    the elevating the land above it. If the sea had retired from the land,
    the retiring must have been equal in all places; this we are sure is
    not the case, therefore it is the land in that particular place that
    must be risen.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the manner I suppose all land to have been first brought to light,
    <span class="pagenum">60</span>
    many islands have been produced in our own time. What was under the
    water is forced above it. The marine substances on the surface by
    degrees decay; moss appears, grass succeeds, then the smaller kind of
    plants, bushes and trees. Animal life begins and goes on upon the same
    scale from the minuter, to beings of more consequence. This system is
    at least as general as the other, but like that must be received with
    many restrictions; for it is certain that by far the greater part of
    vegetables and animals would never be found self-produced in any one
    place, tho’ many might live, and indeed flourish, if brought there.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">61</span></p>

  <p>
    Let us proceed from reasoning to facts. Some voyager discovers an
    island evidently formed by a vulcano, and very remote from other
    countries; it is a perfect wood to the water’s edge, has some plants
    which exist no where but in that spot, together with others common to
    places in the same latitude. It is full of insects, reptiles, birds,
    and sometimes quadrupeds. Now, if <em>every one</em> of these organized bodies
    was not brought there, something must be self-produced.
  </p>

  <p>
    In some islands of the East-Indies are serpents of an enormous size;
    who could carry them there? In all streams there are fish—how could
    they get there? Not from the sea, for fish which inhabit the source of
    <span class="pagenum">62</span>
    rivers are as soon killed by salt water as in air, besides there are
    many rivers which do not run into the ocean. Perhaps this circumstance
    was never sufficiently considered. Every set of rivers is perfectly
    distinct from any other set. The greater number have some fish which
    exist no where but in the particular stream they are bred. Find any
    other cause for their first production than what must be taken from the
    old philosophy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us attend to what we have always near us. Fill a vessel with water
    from the pump: it is pure, and contains neither animal, nor vegetable.
    After standing some days, a green substance begins to be formed in it,
    and which is inhabited by myriads of little beings:
    <span class="pagenum">63</span> this seems the
    first step towards plants and animals. We are told indeed that the
    animalcules are from eggs laid by flies, and the green slime is a plant
    which has its proper seed. That the water may accidentally receive
    both eggs and seeds is highly probable; but these (by reasoning from
    other instances) seem the first efforts towards vegetable and animal
    life. Besides, it yet remains to be proved, that the air so abounds
    with flying seeds and insects. If the air swarmed, as is supposed,
    vision would be obstructed (as by a fog which consists of particles
    inconceivably small), and perhaps life in the nobler animals destroyed.
    The slime to be produced from seed then must have
    <span class="pagenum">64</span> come from some of
    the same sort in the neighbourhood; besides, if its being produced in
    the water depended upon accident, which it does by this supposition,
    it must sometimes fail. Again, if the animals and vegetables, in
    the above instance, were from eggs floating in the air, why are the
    smallest always produced first? must it not sometimes happen that ova
    of a larger sort precede the smaller? which is never the case: not to
    mention the total impossibility of some ova, particularly of animals,
    being so conveyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is well known that by pepper-water, and a variety of other mixtures,
    peculiar animalcules are produced. Can we suppose that the
    <span class="pagenum">65</span> fly, which
    lays the egg from which this creature exists, continues floating in the
    air until some philosopher makes a mixture proper for its deposit? is
    it done often enough to preserve the species? What must the fly have
    done before pepper was brought from India? You may tell me that the egg
    was deposited there—well then, if the eggs are not hurt by the pepper
    being dried in an oven, happen to be brought to Europe, and fall in the
    way of a naturalist, the species is preserved. Much is not got by this.
    There is great reason for believing that the animalcule was really
    produced by the infusion, and did not exist before.
  </p>

  <p>
    How are the worms in human bodies to be accounted for? There
    <span class="pagenum">66</span> are some,
    it is true, which bear a resemblance to earth-worms, and are supposed
    to be eggs we take in with roots, vegetables, &amp;c. Not to insist upon
    the impossibility of a creature intended to live in the cold earth
    existing on the hot stomach, it is well known that there are worms in
    the intestines which have no resemblance to any other thing in the
    creation—the jointed worm, for instance, which is found of many yards
    in length: indeed, if some accounts are to be credited, of some scores
    of yards. Where does this animal exist except in the stomach where it
    is found? Sheep, dogs, horses, &amp;c. breed worms peculiar to themselves.
    I have seen frequently between the sound and
    <span class="pagenum">67</span> back-bone of a whiting,
    long worms that were evidently bred there. As I have no system to
    support, I shall have no objection if you can account for these facts
    according to the present philosophy—but to me it seems absolutely
    impossible.
  </p>

  <p>
    I may strengthen every thing I have advanced on self-production with
    additional arguments, and those from instances on the largest scale.
    The old and new continents are two immense islands. You will get little
    by supposing them once joined at Kamchatka. What should ever induce
    those animals which are never seen out of a hot climate, to travel so
    far North as the Strait between the continents? They do not
    <span class="pagenum">68</span> approach
    it now, why should they then? Besides, has not each continent some
    creatures peculiar to itself? Did those in America come from countries
    where no such animals exist? If they did not, and are found in America
    only, what is the fair conclusion?
  </p>

  <p>
    When an inhabitant of the old continent asks how America was peopled,
    why does the question stop there? How was it supplied with vegetables
    and animals? particularly river-fish; and whence came those creatures
    that exist no where else? Pray, what is to hinder an American from
    reversing the question? When did our people, he may say, first migrate
    and give inhabitants to the Eastern world?
    <span class="pagenum">69</span> What answer can be given to
    these questions confident with the present system of philosophy?
  </p>

  <p>
    There is something in the sound of self-production which seems like
    a contradiction. I mean nothing more by it, than that a vegetable or
    animal does in many instances first exist by a different principle
    than that upon which the species is afterwards continued. As the term
    does not exactly express this, it may easily be perverted from the
    sense in which I wish to be understood. Perhaps we shall find that
    self-production shocks the imagination more or less according to the
    <em>size</em> of the thing produced. Who would not sooner believe that cheese
    breeds mites, than that deserts produce elephants?
    <span class="pagenum">70</span> And yet, according
    to our present philosophy, one is as possible as the other.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the consequences I have drawn from these facts appear to you wrong,
    or the facts themselves ill-supported—convince me of my error, and the
    whole shall be retracted as freely as it is advanced by

    always gives me pleasure when by accident I can trace the meaning of
    a word or phrase to its source, and pursue it through its various

    gradual refinement of language from obscurity and barbarism, until it
    arrives at precision and elegance. Our tongue, as every one knows, is

    and the English resuming its old place. Chaucer in his character of the

    This is the remains of the French <i xml:lang="fr">embonpoint</i>, or as it was written
    then <i xml:lang="fr">en bon point</i>.——The phrase was wearing out in Chaucer’s time,
    the <i xml:lang="fr">en bon</i> being translated, and <i xml:lang="fr">point</i> preserved. Now, the whole

    “The days are now a cock-stride longer,” say the country-folks at
    Twelfth-day—and many have been the conjectures upon the derivation
    of this phrase (see the Gentleman’s Magazine). It is not cock-stride,
    but cock’s-tread. In the country, <em>tread</em> is pronounced <em>trede</em>, (not
    <em>tred</em>)—and in most of the western counties, Devonshire excepted,
    <em>stride</em> has more of the <em>e</em> than <em>i</em> in its sound.—But the
    impossibility of expressing by any known signs the different provincial
    modifications of the sound of the vowels, has occasioned some strange
    mistakes when people of one county endeavour to write down an
    expression used in another. Our old poets, who generally writ in the
    <span class="pagenum">74</span>
    dialect of the province where they resided, and spelt as well as they
    could with their own country vowels, have given birth to much laughable
    criticism.

  <p>
    <em>Help-mate</em> is an odd corruption. In the Book of Genesis it is said,
    “it is not good for man to be alone, I will make an help meet for
    him”—that is an help, <em>proper</em> for him—<em>meet</em> is an adjective. But
    these two words, like the first man and his help, soon became one, and
    of late have been corrected into <em>help-mate</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I was reading John Struys’s voyages the other day, I thought I
    discovered the original of the word, and perhaps of the liquor,
    punch; which, if I am right, has nothing
    <span class="pagenum">75</span> to do with that diverting
    personage in puppet-shews of the same name, from whom it is usually
    derived. Struys was at Gomroon in Persia, where he says, he drank——“A
    liquor much in use there, called <em>pale punshen</em>, being compounded of
    arak, sugar, and raisins, which is so bewitching that they cannot
    refrain from drinking it.” I really believe he <em>forgot</em> to mention the
    water—for how in such a climate as the southern part of Persia it was
    possible to drink undiluted arak, I have no conception. The raisins
    have given place, and very properly, to lemons. But I had better leave
    this to its own merits.—I am afraid it will not bear too minute an
    examination—remember it is only<span class="pagenum">76</span>
    <em>humbly</em> offered together with the other conjectures of

    As Struys’s Voyages is a scarce book, I might with great ease have
    practised the common trick of authors, and introduced <em>water</em> into the
    quotation without fear of discovery. It being supposed that few will
    give themselves the trouble to turn to the original book to examine
    extracts, authors have been made to give evidence to facts, “of which
    they nothing know,” and to support systems which never had existence,
    but in the imagination of the writer who presses them into his service.

    <span class="dropcap">T</span>HE rubs and difficulties which the public throw in the way of a genius
    at his first appearance, are frequently too great to be surmounted.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are apt to form our opinion of a man’s abilities, by his resemblance
    to some other man of reputation in the art or science he professes.
    A painter, musician, or author perfectly new we are afraid to
    commend—like hounds, we wait for the opening of one whose cry we may
    venture to follow.—But it<span class="pagenum">78</span>
    should be remembered that a sure mark of a
    genius is originality. As he is original, and therefore new, perhaps it
    may be necessary to conquer some prepossessions before we can judge of
    his merit; and as he is generally incapable, from that modesty which
    so frequently attends ability, of insisting on his own excellencies,
    the world should take that task from him.—But does it so? Or from the
    fear of commending too hastily, leave a Being to languish in obscurity,
    which should be protected and encouraged. The greatest part of those
    who seem to have been born to make mankind happy, were themselves
    miserable. A melancholy catalogue might be made of
    <span class="pagenum">79</span> these. If we know
    any thing of Homer, it is, that he ran about ballad-singing. Poor,
    unhappy, half-starved Cervantes, Camöens, Butler, Fielding! Does it
    not grieve you to be told that the author of Tom Jones lies in the
    factory’s burying-ground at Lisbon, undistinguished, unregarded—not
    a stone to mark the place! And would it not raise our indignation to
    behold stately monuments erected for those whose names were never heard
    of, until they appeared in their epitaph?——were they not considered
    rather as monuments of the sculptor’s art, than as preserving the
    memory of the persons whose dust they so pompously cover.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum">80</span></p>

  <p>
    The instances of those original geniuses who in their life-time have
    enjoyed the public applause and lived by it, are very few—indeed I
    cannot recollect any—Garrick excepted. I do not consider Virgil or
    Pope in this light—they are not original. It is true that Shakspeare
    lived well enough, but the money he got was by acting, not writing.
    Milton was in tolerable circumstances, but if he had had nothing more
    to depend on than the profit arising from the sale of the finest poem
    in the world, he must have been starved.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is common when we speak of a genius, to say, he will not be valued
    until he is dead—not that his death is essential to his reputation;
    <span class="pagenum">81</span>
    but there is a necessity of his being known and understood, before he
    can be esteemed; and it generally happens that life is of too short
    duration for that purpose—

    I believe wherever it is <em>perceived</em>, it disgusts. There is something
    very ridiculous in the pains of an author when he is searching for a
    set of words beginning with the same letter: this surely argues a “lack
    of matter.” A man who has <em>things</em> in his head, is never curious about
    <em>words</em>, unless it be those which express his meaning quickest and
    clearest. I would have given something to have seen
    <span class="pagenum">84</span> the paper upon
    which <cite>Smollet</cite> first sketched the titles of some of his novels. I dare
    say it cost him as much time to fix upon the name <cite>Roderick Random</cite>,
    as to write some of the best parts in that sprightly and entertaining
    performance.——<em>Robert</em> and <em>Richard</em> were common, <em>Roger</em> and
    <em>Ralph</em> were vulgar—there was a necessity for a sounding uncommon
    name, and beginning with an <em>R</em>: at last, by a lucky chance <em>Roderick</em>
    occurred—and <em>Roderick</em> it is.—Do you think me fanciful? I call upon
    <cite>Peregrine Pickle</cite>, and <cite>Ferdinand Fathom</cite> to prove the contrary.

    If we laugh at the hard-sought-for Alliteration of the poet and
    historian, may we not laugh a little<span class="pagenum">85</span>
    louder at that of the comic
    dramatist? Can any language be less that of nature or common
    conversation, than strings of words beginning with an M or N? And yet
    this has been done by one who paints the “Manners living as they rise.”
    It is surprizing that so sprightly a genius as Foote could submit to
    the drudgery of consulting his spelling-book for words proper to be
    paired—my three <em>ppp’s</em> put me in mind of a letter in the Student, in
    which <em>p</em> is predominant—it is highly humourous and well worth your

    The Germans in pronouncing English, and writing it too, if they have
    not studied the language, almost constantly change <em>b</em> into <em>p</em>, <em>d</em>
    into <em>t</em>, <em>g</em> (hard) into <em>k</em>, <em>v</em> into <em>f</em>, and the reverse. This
    peculiarity of theirs, I find, upon recollection, is not confined to
    English. In the Burletta of <i xml:lang="it">La buona Figliola</i>, the author makes
    his German character to say <i xml:lang="it">trompetti</i> and <i xml:lang="it">tampurri</i>—nay they
    serve their own language the same, as I have observed from their
    pronunciation of proper names of cities, &amp;c. it seems difficult to

    none, and omitting it where it should be used.——I once saw a

    not in those of the scornful, but of the losers? When you quit the game

    Each ticket in a lottery has an equal chance——do you think so?
    Number 1000 got the great prize in the last lottery—now, confess
    honestly that you feel something within that tells you the same
    number can never win the great prize again—you would prefer every
    other number to it—and yet reason<span class="pagenum">90</span>
    says, that all the tickets have
    an equal probability of success. In these instances and many others,
    superstition, even in cultivated minds, will be always more than a
    match for truth.

    A gentleman coming a passenger in a vessel from the West-Indies,
    finding it more inconvenient to be shaved than to wear his beard, chose
    the latter——but he was not suffered to have his choice long—it
    was the unanimous opinion of the sailors, and indeed of the Captain
    as well, that there was not the least probability of a wind as long
    as this ominous beard was suffered to grow. They petitioned—they
    remonstrated, and at last prepared to cut the fatal hairs by violence.
    <span class="pagenum">91</span>
    Now, as there is no operation at which it is so much the patient’s
    interest to consent, as that of the barber——the gentleman quietly
    submitted—nor could the wind resist the potent spell which instantly
    filled all their sails, and “wafted them merrily away.”

    <span class="dropcap">I</span> Have often tryed to have a proper idea of vast space—great
    numbers—enormous size and such subjects, and as you may suppose,
    without success. But though I fail in getting a competent idea, I
    sometimes make an approach towards it, which is better than nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solar system is one of these sublime subjects in the consideration
    of which I have frequently been lost. I never attempted to conceive
    the size of the sun, or the<span class="pagenum">93</span>
    distance of saturn; the impossibility
    instantly repels the most daring imagination. No, all that I have
    attempted is to have a just idea of the proportion (upon any scale)
    that the sun and planets bear to each other in respect to size and
    distance. At first sight, this seems easily done—Draw some concentric
    circles on a sheet of paper, make the sun the centre, and place the
    planets round in their order.—Or if you would have an idea of their
    motion as well, look at an orrery. But a little examination will
    convince you that this is doing nothing towards having an idea of
    their size and distance in proportion to each other, which is the
    point sought. Nay, it is worse than nothing, for
    <span class="pagenum">94</span> it imposes a falsity
    as a reality. Imagination by itself can do a great deal, if assisted
    it can do more, but if perverted, nothing. Let us try to assist the
    imagination then.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the sun be only a million times bigger than the earth, (exactness
    is of no consequence to my argument, so that I am within the truth) it
    is plain that I cannot make two circles upon a sheet of paper (without
    considering any thing about distance) that can bear this proportion to
    each other; and if this cannot be done for the earth, much less can it
    for other planets and moons where the disproportion is greater. Let
    us take the floor of a large room—on this make a circle of two feet
    diameter for the sun—the size of<span class="pagenum">95</span>
    the earth will be about a large
    pin’s head. The distance of the sun from the earth is about eighty of
    the sun’s diameters; if so, there must be a circle of three hundred
    and twenty feet diameter for the earth’s orbit, which no room, nor
    indeed any other building, will contain. Let us try a field——here
    we may put our sun and draw the earth’s orbit round. If we stand in
    the center (which we should do) the earth is too small to be seen.
    These difficulties occurring so soon, how will they increase when we
    take in the superior planets? The ingenious Ferguson has endeavoured
    to assist our imagination by supposing St. Paul’s dome, in diameter
    one hundred and forty-five feet, to be the
    <span class="pagenum">96</span> sun——upon this scale,
    Mercury is between nine and ten inches, and placed at the Tower; Venus
    near eighteen, at St. James’s Palace; the Earth eighteen, at Marybone;
    Mars ten, at Kensington; Jupiter fifteen feet, at Hampton-Court; and
    Saturn eleven feet and half, at Cliffden. Let us be on the top of
    the dome, and look for the planets where he has placed them. Do you
    think we could see any thing of Jupiter and Saturn? to say nothing
    of their moons—or that we could conceive properly the difference
    between four miles and twenty, when seen on a line? the four may be
    two, or one mile; and the twenty may be ten, or thirty, for ought we
    can judge by the appearance.<span class="pagenum">97</span>
    All that we get by this is the knowing
    that a sheet of paper or an orrery give us wrong ideas, and that we
    cannot by any contrivance put the size and distance of the planets upon
    a proportionable scale, so as to take in the whole with our eye or
    understanding.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are as much at a loss to comprehend the slowness of their motion—I
    have not mistaken—I mean slowness.—A circuit which is six or
    twelve months or twice as many years performing, is slow almost
    beyond conception; and yet this motion is called whirling—as if the
    planets went round their orbits like a top! Though quick and slow are
    comparative terms, we have ideas of each arising from the
    <span class="pagenum">98</span> medium of
    the two, from observation, and common application, that do not stand in
    need of any comparison to be understood. The motion of a flea is quick;
    of a snail, slow; and the common walk of a man is neither quick nor
    slow. Let us imagine an elephant to walk, and a flea to hop the same
    distance in the same time—would you hesitate to say that the motion of
    the one was slow, and the other quick? In short, swiftness or slowness
    does not depend upon the absolute quantity of ground the animal passes
    in a certain time, but upon the relative quantity to its own size.
    The earth is about eight minutes in moving the space of one diameter,
    therefore<span class="pagenum">99</span>
    its absolute motion is slow—it is twenty-four hours making
    one revolution round its axis, which gives no idea of velocity. It
    is certain that if we were placed very near the earth (unaffected
    by its attraction) there would appear an exceeding quick change of
    surface—and so would the motion of a snail appear to an animalcule.
    The quantity of space when compared to any we can move in the same time
    is vast, and the motion quick, but when considered as belonging to a
    body of the size of a world, the motion is slow. Suppose a common globe
    was turned round once in twenty-four hours—imagine an animal as much
    inferior to it in size as we are to the earth, placed
    <span class="pagenum">100</span> as I conceived
    the human spectator placed to view the earth—would the apprehension
    of this Being induce you to call a single revolution in twenty-four
    hours, whirling? Would not you say that though the surface passed quick
    in review before him, yet that the absolute motion of the whole was
    exceedingly slow. Perhaps it is our measuring this motion by miles that
    makes us fancy that it is quick, which is much like taking the height
    of a mountain in hairs-breadths. When we are told that Saturn moves in
    his orbit more than twenty-two thousand miles in an hour, we conceive
    the velocity to be great; but when we find that he is more than three
    hours moving his own diameter,<span class="pagenum">101</span>
    we must then think it as it really is,
    slow. Bishop Wilkins is the only writer I have met with who considers
    the motion of the heavenly bodies as I do, and I am rather proud of
    having my opinion supported by so great a man.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is another circumstance which prevents the solar system, as
    commonly delineated, from bearing a true resemblance to the apparent
    position and motion of the planets. It is always drawn in plan instead
    of section, whereas the <em>appearance</em> of the orbits of the heavenly
    bodies is always in section and never can be in plan. This difference
    is not, as far as I know, noticed in any account of the solar system;
    and yet if it be not attended to, it is
    <span class="pagenum">102</span> impossible to prove the truth
    of the system by the apparent paths of the planets. This will be best
    understood by considering the inferior ones. Mercury and Venus remove
    to a certain distance from the sun, and then, after seeming at rest,
    return in nearly the same line and remove to the same distance on the
    other side, where the same thing is repeated. This to the eye is not
    a revolution in plan, but a revolution in section—and this might
    be explained by a draught which should always accompany the common
    delineation of the planetary orbits.

    Quarles sometimes introduces personages, and makes his poem of the

    and <em>Death</em>; as usual, alluding to the print, where <em>Death</em> is going
    to extinguish the taper, but is prevented by <em>Time</em>. There are a

    There is nothing which destroys the <em>reality</em> in a dramatic dialogue
    more than when the speakers ask questions and reply in an equal
    quantity of lines. Perhaps the most disgusting instance of this is in
    Milton’s Mask, where Comus and the Lady have a verse each alternately,
    for fourteen lines together. We are more sensible of the sameness in
    quantity where it is so short, and so often repeated, than here in
    Quarles where it is extended to a stanza, and that repeated for each
    speaker but once—but<span class="pagenum">107</span>
    even here you begin to feel its bad effect,
    when it is finely relieved towards the end by the characters growing
    warmer in their dispute, and, of course, making their speeches shorter.
    Yet what I here condemn, others admire.——You, who are so fond of the
    ancients, may easily defend this practice by their example, and if you
    want any assistance to demolish me, may call in Mr. West and the author
    of the Origin and Progress of Language.—This passage of the former
    from his translation of the Iphigenia of Euripedes is quoted by the
    latter with great commendations——not indeed because the dialogue is
    in alternate verse, but for its being a fine imitation of the ancient
    trochaic measure.

    It is true that here the reply wants one of having the same number of
    syllables as the question—but still the constant return of the same
    quantity for each speaker is disgusting to all unprejudiced ears. You
    will tell me that it is in the high gusto of the antique, and that the
    feet are trochaics—I can only reply, that hard words cannot convince
    me contrary to reason, and if a proper effect is not produced, it is
    of very little consequence to me whether the authority is brought from
    Greece or Siberia. Horace’s<span class="pagenum">109</span>
    often-quoted <cite>Pallida mors</cite>, &amp;c. was
    perhaps never better translated than at the end of the fourth stanza.

  <p>
    The ninth hieroglyphic will put you in mind of the poems that are
    squeezed or stretched into the form of axes, altars, and wings——but
    if you will attend to the matter, and not the form, you will find it
    excellent——to write this properly requires some care.

    Methinks Quarles’s ghost is at my elbow, which will not be appeased
    unless I remark that the first lines of each stanza make a verse, being
    the text on which the poem is a comment.

  <p class="noindent">
    This is a kind of false wit once much in request. Jarvis, the
    translator<span class="pagenum">112</span>
    of Don Quixote, calls it <em>glossing</em>—upon what authority I
    know not. In the first chapter of the second book of the second volume
    may be found a text and gloss—with this difference from Quarles’s,
    that the text is introduced at the end of the stanza and not at the
    beginning.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is impossible to avoid smiling at the pains he must have taken to
    preserve the form of the stanza—in the third he is obliged to have
    the assistance of figures, or his line would have been too long; and
    after all his trouble there must be some for the reader before he has
    calculated how much “12 moons, twice 5 times told,” are——in the
    rest, to say the truth, it is not so apparent. If this pyramidical
    <span class="pagenum">113</span>
    stanza prevents you from attending to the poetry, it is easily put in
    another—of the two first lines make one; and the false wit immediately
    vanishes.—I hope Quarles’s ghost vanished before I proposed the
    alteration.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have, like a prudent caterer, reserved the best thing for the last.
    It is the twelfth emblem of the third book. The subject of the print is
    a figure trying to escape from the Divine vengeance which is pursuing
    in thunders: the motto——<i>O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave,
    that thou wouldst keep me in secret until thy wrath be past!</i> Upon this
    hint he has produced the following excellent poem.

    Six stanzas, which though very good, yet being of less merit than the
    rest are omitted. It is obvious that he had the 139th psalm in his
    eye, of which he has made great use. The alarm at the beginning—the
    searching all nature for shelter—the impossibility of being hid
    from the author of nature—and the acquiescing at last in what was
    unavoidable, are grand and natural ideas. The motion of the wings of
    vengeance—and the recapitulation of the places where protection was
    fought in vain—are instances<span class="pagenum">116</span>
    of expression rarely met with. But
    what praise is sufficient for the simile in the eighth stanza? To
    say only that it is apposite and beautiful, comes very short of my
    sensations when I read it. Let me confess honestly that I think it
    one of the noblest instances of the sublime pathetic! As a part of a
    religious poem it is proper, in a high degree; the scripture frequently
    considering our connection with the Almighty as that of children
    with a parent.—As a pictoresque image it is distinct, natural, and
    affecting.—But to remark all the beauties of this poem would be to
    comment on every stanza.——You will have more pleasure in finding them
    out yourself.

    Now what think you, is not this rather too good to be lost? Was it from
    never reading Quarles, or taking his character from common report, that
    Pope considered his productions as the very bathos of poetry? Poor
    Quarles! thou hast had many enemies, and art now forgotten. But thou
    hast at last found a friend—not equal, indeed, to the task of turning
    a tide that has been flowing for a hundred years against thee—not
    equal to his wishes for giving thee and every neglected genius his due
    share of reputation—but barely capable of laying the first stone of
    thy temple of fame, which he leaves to be compleated by abler and by
    stronger hands!

    P. S. I had forgot to inform you that these emblems were imitated in
    Latin by one Herman Hugo, a Jesuit. The first edition of them was in
    1623, soon after the appearance of Quarles; and the book was reprinted
    for the ninth time in 1676, which last is the date of the copy in my
    possession. How many more editions there have been, I know not. He
    makes no acknowledgement to Quarles, and speaks of his own work as
    original. As a specimen of his manner, take the following, which is
    intended as an imitation of “Ah whither shall I fly?”

    You express an inclination to publish my letters. You should consider
    that the date of some of them is so far back, that many allusions
    to passing incidents which might engage attention at the time, now
    must fail of their effect.——People are spoken of as living, who are
    dead——and many other objections might be enumerated.
    <span class="pagenum">120</span> However, you
    are at liberty to do what you please with them. Those which are of
    a private nature, your prudence will, of course, keep to yourself:
    and for the others, where some conjectures are hazarded which may be
    thought different from received opinions; the writer wishes them to be
    read with the same impartiality they were written——though he is well
    apprized of the difficulty of dispossessing old opinions.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
